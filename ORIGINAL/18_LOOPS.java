// LOOPS - A loops is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated untill a certain condition is reached.

// Types of Loops: 
// 1) for-loop
// 2) While-loop
// 3) do-whilep-loop

// [Note: If the condition never becomes false then the loop will keep getting executed, and such kind of loop is known as Infinite Loop.]

// 1) While_Loop -> Here the loop will continue to execute till the condition is met.
 
// Syntax: 
// while (boolean condition)
// {
//     Code block to be executed
//     Updation;
// }

// 2) For_Loop -> A for loop is used to execute a piece of code for a specific no.of times.

// Syntax: 
// for (initialize;condition;updation)
// {
//     Code block to be executed
// }


// 3) Do_While_loop -> This loop is similiar to "While_loop" except the fact that here it is guaranteed that the loop will execute once.
//                     Here the code is executed first then the condition is checked


// Syntax:
// do
// {
//     Code block to be executed
// }
// while (condition)
